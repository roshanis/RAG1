Plan for Building a RAG-Based Application with Next.js and Tailwind

1. Project Overview

Objective: Build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application that can ingest documents from a folder, create vector embeddings, store them in a FAISS vector database, and answer user queries based on the stored data.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: Next.js (React framework) with Tailwind CSS for styling.
Backend: Next.js API routes for server-side logic.
Vector Database: FAISS for efficient similarity search.
LLM: OpenAI for generating embeddings and answering questions.
Libraries:
faiss or faiss-cpu for vector storage and search.
openai for embeddings and LLM interactions.
pdf-lib or similar for parsing PDFs (if needed).
fs and path for file system operations.
tailwindcss for styling.

2. Application Flow

Ingestion:
User uploads a folder containing documents (PDFs, text files, etc.).
Backend processes the files, extracts text, and generates embeddings using OpenAI.
Embeddings are stored in a FAISS index.
Querying:
User asks a question via the frontend.
Backend converts the question into an embedding, searches the FAISS index for similar documents, and retrieves relevant chunks.
The retrieved chunks are passed to OpenAI's LLM to generate a coherent answer.
Frontend:
A simple UI for uploading folders and asking questions.
Display the answers in a user-friendly format.

3. Backend Implementation

Step 1: Set Up Next.js API Routes
Create API routes for handling file uploads, embeddings, and querying.
